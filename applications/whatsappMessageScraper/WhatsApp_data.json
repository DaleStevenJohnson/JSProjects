It's makes everything look very summery though \n\nYeah, should be home in about 20/30 minutes  unfortunately there is a strike on one of the trains tomorrow, so this is probably the earliest I'll be home this week \n\nAre you still soaking up the last of the evening warmth in the garden? \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/19/2018","time":"20:54"}},"627":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"That's very true. I want to make icecream with strawberry pieces! \n\nOh no, are there a lot of strikes on the trains? Is Sam cooking again? \n\nNo I'm inside now watching thrones with dinner.

I made some ice cream with my mum at Christmas, I can't remember the flavour, and I can't actually remember  eating it, but I remember it looking really good... \nHave you made ice cream before?\n\nJust one big strike on one of the three train lines I have to take to get to work/home. Apparently it's a 25 minute walk instead, I might wear shorts tomorrow... \n\nHopefully, but I doubt it. I don't mind whipping something up for us when I get back though \n\nNice, what are you having for dinner? \nMy plans are purely of food and sleep. And Sam will probably talk at me for a while about something just as I want to go to bed. Last night it was CenterParks...\nI feel fairly awake this evening, I might even get a chapter of the painted man in! \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/19/2018","time":"21:09"}},"629":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"I've made it once before and I believe it was strawberry.

He didn't, but I cooked us spaghetti and meatballs, which is my favourite \n\nI don't really remember, I think he had talked about it with someone else before I got home and then it just worked its way into the conversation.  I've never been, and he loves it, so it was like he was giving me a little sales pitch \nHave you ever been?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/19/2018","time":"22:08"}},"631":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"Yay! It did seem quite healthy  I quite like vegetarian dinners. I think I need to try your spaghetti and meatballs, it's fast becoming a favourite of mine too! \n\nI've been when I was younger.

Have you been sold on the idea?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/19/2018","time":"22:42"}},"632":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"Yeah, vegetarian dinners are normally tastier than their meat counterparts. In fact, our \"meatballs\" were actually quornballs \nYou're right, you do, I need to cook for you sometime soon \n\nI would definitely consider it, it seems pretty accomodating for whatever you do or don't want to do. I think it would be best in a group of 6 - 8, although maybe that's just how Sam sold it to me \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/19/2018","time":"23:07"}},"633":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"I don't think I've ever had quorn in a meal but I could be wrong!  The idea of you cooking makes me very happy just like when you gave me the flower . \n\nI guess with more people you'll have people who will want to do the same activity as you.

Did you sleep well? \n\nCentreparcs definitely feels like a holiday to play games in the evenings.

Time flies when you're teaching maths! \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"07:13"}},"637":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"I was out like a light too but reading until 11.30 might not have been a good idea! \n\nNo holidays planned yet, i need to pin down a travel partner  everyone is so busy or skint it seems! \n\nDid the strike put you behind schedule today?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"08:13"}},"638":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"Agreed, all these late nights are no good! \n\nYeah, it's so hard planning things with anyone these days. If you had to pick a place to go, where would you choose? (Your answer can't be a form of \"anywhere - i don't mind\" )\n\nThey called the strike off! My journey was completely unaffected AND I got a seat on the first train! Absolutely golden morning! \n\nWhat's your Friday timetable like?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"08:32"}},"639":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"Darn that was what I was going to say! How about anywhere - except a war zone?  \n\nErm well if it was this country then the new forest or scotland. If it was another country then maybe a Greek island or a shorter break to Rome perhaps. Where would you go? \n\nYay! That's great news!! Well I've just had y11 and we finished bearings although they had forgotten everything from yesterday's lesson! I have a planning slot now and then y10 (shape), y9 (angles), statistics (averages) and year 8 (probability). Fridays are my busy days as I also have morning and break duty .

There clearly weren't enough incentive cookies involved yesterday \n\nWow, that's a hectic end to the week! Do you have to patrol around and sniff out trouble on break duty, or is it more relaxed? \nNo problems for me so far, which probably means they're waiting to build up into one big mega-problem, but I'm enjoying the calm while it lasts \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"10:25"}},"641":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"Me too, Rome is definitely a sightseeing trip! I've been to Edinburgh but I'd like to do the Highlands, Ireland is a good choice! Have you been to America before? \n\nThey understood perfectly yesterday and then today they were measuring bearings anticlockwise instead of clockwise.\n\nI have a long corridor to patrol and get to tell kids to leave the building so it's nice and relaxed. I'd hate to have to do an outside duty! \n\nThat's good  did you bring the blanket today?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"10:29"}},"642":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"Yep, absolutely! \nThe Highlands would be good - are you a fan of hiking?\nNo, I've never been to America, always wanted to though, I've seen some awesome landscapes from there. \n\nD'oh! Your job must make you feel like banging your head against the wall sometimes...\n\nNice  Is outside duty a lot tougher?\n\nNo blanket, and no shorts today, but I feel more energised, might actually do something productive in my down time \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"10:47"}},"643":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"I am, I even have my own hiking boots. Are you? \n\nSo you fancy an American road trip? \n\nThat is exactly how it feels . I imagine so as that's were fights normally take place.

Duty and two lessons call.... 2 hours until lunch!\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"10:50"}},"644":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"Wow! Yeah, love a good hike - where do you stand on camping?\n\nYeah, you can't get much better than a good road trip \n\nAre fights quite regular there then? If you did have to break one up, I think they would regret summoning the wrath of Miss Mitten!\n\nI was going to do some programming, but the problems have started rolling in now, and i just stupidly dropped a big metal board on my foot, which is a little bit distracting  Time for lunch I think...\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"12:13"}},"645":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"Camping is good too so long as the site has a shower block! Do you like camping? \n\nErm there have been a few in the lunch area that I can see from my classroom. I don't think I'd fare well in breaking up a fight I'd probably be knocked out or something .  \n\nOh no! I take it you can still walk? I've just noticed that there are lumps of glue on my ceiling... I wonder which of my kids launched the lumps up there \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"12:54"}},"646":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"It's everywhere...

I'm sure they would all flee if they caught wind that you were on the war path \n\nYeah, still striding around, the pain has subsided quite a lot now, which is nice.\nHahaha, Glue?! As in, lumps of pritt stick? \nOh no! Hope you're not stuck! \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"13:11"}},"648":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"That's right, lumps of pritt stick.

I forgot to take a photo though. James met me in my room and we've done the tip run and are now chilling in the garden . \n\nErm... maybe 10 years ago during duke of Edinburgh.

Do you tan well?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"16:25"}},"652":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"Aw, that's good  Does he act differently around you when he's at school vs at home?\n\nWhere did you camp for Duke of Edinburgh?\nI think we are working at a festival in London in a couple of weeks, but I don't think I'll be working a proper farm-field festival this year.

Do you?\n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"16:49"}},"653":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"Well if it's during school time he'll act all embarrassed if I say hello to him which is quite cute. Other than that not really, he's quite a good boy compared to others in the school I think. \n\nIt was somewhere in kent but I can't remember where. None of my team could navigate apart from me, when the boys tried we went in a circle three times \n\nOoohhh what kind of festival is it? \n\nI either burn or freckle. So I'm not a fan either \n","timestamp":{"date":"4/20/2018","time":"17:09"}},"654":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"Haha  That's good  \n\nI feel like I would have totally been one of the boys walking in a circle, certain he had the navigation down to a tee \n\nIt is a music festival in Victoria park, I can't remember its name...

I think you have a good sense of direction \n\nI think I know the one you mean! My cousins who live in London have been before. Hopefully it isn't a heatwave when the festival is on \n\nFirst blush for the day! \n\nWell we've just done some gardening, mum's friend has just put up a new clock for us and I'm now heading to bunnings to get more garden supplies. I am very proud of you!

Right at dinner time too! \n\nIt's part of a series of challenges that Sam got me into last year.

It sounds like an unusual place to work!\n","timestamp":{"date":"5/1/2018","time":"22:08"}},"985":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"I've never had both together, sounds like something I'd like though! \n\nThat's ominous!

I don't think they have ice cream and fruit here though... \nMmm, that sounds like a good idea! I need to make sure I buy ice cream on Sunday!\n\nYeah, exactly that. I can put up with an unmade bed for a week though, it's just like being at home \n\nThe Dale nest is a chilly and dark place, with clothes and food in discrete piles in the corner and a big swirl of duvet and pillows in the bed, you can almost see the imprint from where he was sleeping.\n\nThe stubble is becoming less scratchy by the day! I daresay it will be almost beardlike by Sunday...\n\nThere is definitely a Hannah and Dale sized space in the shower, plenty of room to get soapy...\n\nI didn't take any outside of the studio setup we have - I'll try and take some pictures when it's a bit quieter tonight so you can get a feel for the space. \n\nAre you still watching the film? Would you recommend it?\n","timestamp":{"date":"5/1/2018","time":"22:23"}},"987":{"person":"Hannah Mitten","message":"I would recommend it, I'd even watch it again at some point... maybe snuggled up at the same time with a certain someone... \n\nThat's sounds like a plan. I wonder what flavour will taste best on you. Any suggestions? \n\nDo you not like making the bed? I must admit I can be a bother lax sometimes when it comes to being tidy. \n\nOh no I'm sad to hear it's chilly. I wish I was there to warm it up for you! I can't wait to see your beardlike face . That sounds nice it'd have to be a very long shower though. \n\nIt'd be interesting to see the pictures of the place and perhaps one of you as well? \n\nI'm going to catch some zzzz. Let me know when you are awake tomorrow so that I don't disturb you. Goodnight to my favourite Dale! Sleep well xxx\n","timestamp":{"date":"5/1/2018","time":"22:40"}},"988":{"person":"Dale Johnson","message":"I really hope you pick me as that certain someone \n\nHmm, I think cherry and vanilla would go quite nicely \n\nWhen it's just me that will see the bed, I don't really see the point in making it. Plus I like to get back into the spot I woke up in because it's already got my shape in it... If that makes sense \nBeing constantly tidy is super hard. I feel I'm pretty good at it, but it always gets the better of me and I have to spend a day having a super-tidy-up.\n\nI can't wait to see your face either \n\nI will send you a picture of me once I've slept and showered  but I will want one of you in return! \n\nI hope you had a good sleep, and I also hope this message didn't wake you.

I will take a picture once I'm all ready for the day and I'll send it later on . \n\nYour message didn't wake me and I hope this one doesn't wake you!
